Welcome — I’m Cassidy.

I’m a linguist and NLP enthusiast with a passion for language, data, and making technology more human. I combine sociolinguistics, sentiment analysis, and customer insight to bridge the gap between how people speak and how systems understand.

Let’s build better tools — and better communication — together.
