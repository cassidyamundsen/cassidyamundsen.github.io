## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Cassidy â€” a linguist, NLP enthusiast, and people-first problem solver.

I specialize in bridging the gap between language and technology, with a unique blend of academic insight and real-world experience. I hold a Masterâ€™s in Linguistics from UNC Chapel Hill, where I focused on computational linguistics, dialectal variation, and bias in AI systems.

Beyond the classroom, I bring over 8 years of success in sales and customer-facing roles. From fine dining to client consultations, Iâ€™ve honed the ability to listen, connect, and deliver exactly what people need â€” whether thatâ€™s a five-star experience or a strategic insight.

My work combines sociolinguistics, sentiment analysis, and data storytelling to uncover the patterns that shape human communication. I'm fluent in Python, VADER, and SQL, but also fluent in reading people and building trust.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m an avid weightlifter, reader, and lifelong learner. Iâ€™m always chasing progress â€” whether itâ€™s personal, professional, or technical.
