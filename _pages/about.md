Hi! I’m Cassidy Amundsen — a linguist and data analyst with a Master’s in Linguistics from UNC Chapel Hill and a strong background in sociolinguistics, sentiment analysis, and computational linguistics. 

My thesis explored how dialectal variation in African American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE) affects perceptions of authenticity in poetry performance, using Python-based sentiment tools to analyze linguistic data. 

I’m currently expanding my skills in data analytics with Python and SQL, and I bring over 8 years of experience in customer service, sales, and public communication. My goal is to use data-driven language insights to help people connect, understand, and make better decisions.
