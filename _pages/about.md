# About Me

Hi! I’m Cassidy Amundsen — a linguist, data analyst, and people-first strategist who thrives at the intersection of language, behavior, and business.

I hold a Master’s in Linguistics from UNC Chapel Hill, where I focused on sociolinguistics, sentiment analysis, and computational linguistics. My thesis explored how dialectal variation in African American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE) shapes perceptions of authenticity in spoken word poetry. Using Python and tools like VADER, I examined how language bias influences interpretation by both humans and machines.

I’m currently sharpening my technical skills in data analytics with Python and SQL, building on 8+ years of experience in high-pressure sales and customer-facing roles. Across industries, I’ve built trust, solved complex problems, and delivered data-informed strategies that drive real results.

Whether I’m analyzing language patterns, teaching data literacy, or crafting sales solutions in fast-paced environments, I bring a unique ability to translate complexity into clarity — and to connect with people through both numbers and narrative.

If you’re looking for someone who understands both how people speak *and* how they decide — let’s talk.
