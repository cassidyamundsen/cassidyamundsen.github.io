Hi! I’m Cassidy Amundsen — a linguist, data analyst, and people-first strategist who thrives at the intersection of language, behavior, and business.

I hold a Master’s in Linguistics from UNC Chapel Hill with a focus on sociolinguistics, sentiment analysis, and computational linguistics. My thesis explored how dialectal variation in African American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE) influences perceptions of authenticity in spoken word poetry. Using Python and sentiment analysis tools like VADER, I investigated how language bias can affect interpretation in both human and machine audiences.

I’m currently expanding my technical skills in data analytics with Python and SQL, while building on over 8 years of experience in high-pressure sales and customer-facing roles. I’ve worked across industries to build relationships, solve problems, and deliver data-informed strategies that drive results.

Whether I’m analyzing language patterns, teaching data literacy, or crafting solutions in a fast-paced sales environment, I bring a unique ability to translate complexity into clarity — and to connect with people through both numbers and narrative.

If you’re looking for someone who understands both how people speak *and* how they decide — let’s talk.
