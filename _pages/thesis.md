# Thesis

## Authenticity in Performance: Sentiment Analysis of AAE and SAE in Poetry

My thesis explores how dialects â€” particularly African American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE) â€” affect perceptions of authenticity and emotion in spoken word poetry.

Using Python-based tools like VADER for sentiment analysis, I analyzed how computational systems interpret dialectal features and how these interpretations align (or don't) with real-world performances. My work draws on Audience Design, Politeness Theory, and Communication Accommodation Theory to explore how speakers shape identity through dialect choice.
