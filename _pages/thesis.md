## ðŸ“˜ Thesis Title  
**Dialectal Variation and Sentiment in Performance Poetry: A Sociolinguistic and NLP Approach**

My MA thesis explores how dialectal differences â€” particularly African American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE) â€” affect perceived authenticity and sentiment in performance poetry. I applied sentiment analysis tools like VADER alongside sociolinguistic frameworks to uncover how dialect bias influences AI interpretation.

### Tools Used:
- Python
- VADER sentiment analyzer
- Praat (for prosody)
- Manual linguistic annotation (IPA + ToBI)
