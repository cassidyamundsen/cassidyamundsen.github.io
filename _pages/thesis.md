My graduate thesis explored how dialectal variation in African American English (AAE) impacts perceptions of authenticity in spoken-word poetry. I used sentiment analysis, sociolinguistic theory, and interview data to examine how language bias intersects with cultural representation in performance.

**Research highlights:**
- Used Python-based tools (VADER) to analyze sentiment trends.
- Compared linguistic features between AAE and SAE.
- Applied Audience Design and Accommodation Theory.
