## 📘 Thesis Title  
**Dialectal Variation and Sentiment in Performance Poetry: A Sociolinguistic and NLP Approach**

## 🧠 Overview  
My MA thesis explores how dialectal differences — particularly African American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE) — affect perceived authenticity and sentiment in performance poetry. I analyzed both **interview data** and **spoken word performances** using a blend of **sociolinguistic theory** and **computational tools**.

---

## 💻 Methodology  
- Used **VADER** for sentiment analysis  
- Annotated and compared AAE vs. SAE features  
- Applied **Audience Design Theory**, **Accommodation Theory**, and **Authenticity models**  
- Focused on **phonological, grammatical, and prosodic** markers of AAE

---

## 🔍 Key Findings  
- Sentiment tools often **misinterpret AAE features**, skewing negative  
- Performers using AAE were more likely to be perceived as “authentic”  
- NLP tools still carry **inherent biases** when analyzing non-standard dialects  
- Linguistic variation **amplifies or suppresses** sentiment scores depending on dialect

---

## 🔧 Tools & Techniques  
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- VADER Sentiment Analyzer  
- Praat (for prosodic data)  
- Manual linguistic annotation (IPA, ToBI)

---

## 🎓 Why It Matters  
This research highlights the **importance of dialectal awareness** in NLP systems — especially those used in media, education, or AI communication. By analyzing how AAE is both **stigmatized and celebrated**, my work contributes to ongoing conversations around **equity, bias, and representation in tech**.
