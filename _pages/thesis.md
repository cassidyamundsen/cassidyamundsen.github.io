**Title:** *Authenticity in Performance: Sentiment Analysis of AAE and SAE in Poetry*

My thesis examined how dialect choice influences perceptions of authenticity in spoken word poetry. I used sentiment analysis tools in Python (e.g., VADER) to evaluate linguistic patterns in interviews and poetry performances, comparing African American English (AAE) with Standard American English (SAE). 

I applied theories such as Audience Design, Communication Accommodation, and Politeness Theory to explore how speakers shift between dialects to manage identity, emotion, and audience perception. This project highlighted limitations in current sentiment tools and emphasized the need for dialect-aware NLP systems.
