### Thesis: **Authenticity, Sentiment, and Dialect in Performance Poetry**

My masterâ€™s thesis explored how dialectal variation (particularly African American English vs. Standard American English) affects perceived authenticity in spoken word poetry.

Using sentiment analysis tools and sociolinguistic theory, I analyzed interviews and performances to highlight how linguistic bias is embedded in automated language processing tools â€” and how these perceptions are shaped by performance style, grammar, and audience alignment.

**Methods used:**
- Python + VADER sentiment analysis
- Linguistic annotation (phonological, prosodic, syntactic)
- Theoretical frameworks: Audience Design, Politeness Theory, Accommodation Theory
