When I’m not working with language or data, I’m moving — physically, mentally, or creatively.

### 🏋️ Weightlifting & Boxing
I thrive on discipline, and lifting heavy is my form of meditation. Whether I’m chasing a personal best or throwing punches in a boxing gym, I bring intensity, focus, and grit into every session.

### 🏌️ Golf
Golf is my balance — a challenge of patience, precision, and strategy. I love how it slows things down and sharpens my ability to stay present under pressure.

### 📖 Reading & Learning
I’m a lifelong learner. Whether it's through books, online courses, or pure curiosity, I’m always diving into new topics — from machine learning and linguistic theory to psychology and business.

These passions reflect how I work: focused, ever-growing, and always learning with purpose.
