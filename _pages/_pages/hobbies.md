When I’m not working with data or studying language, you’ll usually find me moving — physically or mentally.

I’m an avid weightlifter who thrives on discipline and growth. Whether I’m boxing, golfing, or learning something new, I chase progress in everything I do. I’m as passionate about form under a barbell as I am about precision in code.

## Weightlifting & Boxing  
I train regularly to build strength, focus, and mental clarity. Lifting and sparring keep me grounded and goal-oriented — it’s where I go to get sharp, not just strong.

---

## Golf  
I love the mental game of golf. It teaches patience, strategy, and calm under pressure — all of which fuel my mindset outside the course too.

---

## Reading & Learning  
I read constantly. Books, papers, articles — anything that teaches me something new or challenges how I think. Learning is a habit, not a task.

Curiosity drives everything I do — whether it’s in the gym, on the green, or at my keyboard.
