When I’m not working with language or data, I’m moving — physically, mentally, or creatively.

### 🏋️ Weightlifting & Boxing  
I thrive on discipline, and lifting heavy is my form of meditation. Whether I’m chasing a PR or training in the ring, I bring intensity and focus.

### 🏌️ Golf  
A challenge of patience and presence — I love how golf slows things down and sharpens strategy.

### 📚 Reading & Learning  
From machine learning to behavioral science, I’m constantly exploring ideas that sharpen how I think, negotiate, teach, and build.
