Outside of my professional work, I’m deeply passionate about activities that keep me grounded, inspired, and creatively sharp. My hobbies reflect a balance between movement, mindfulness, and self-expression—and they often inform how I connect with people and ideas in meaningful ways.

## Current Interests

- Weight training and running for mental clarity and strength  
- Yoga as a daily grounding and mindfulness practice  
- Writing poetry and personal essays as a creative outlet  
- Professional content writing with a focus on voice, tone, and audience  
- Mixology and recipe development for social and sensory creativity  
- Attending live music and cultural events to stay inspired  

## Personal Growth & Creative Expression

- Hosting or contributing to writing and storytelling events  
- Exploring digital design and emerging technologies  
- Participating in wellness and outdoor retreats  
- Volunteering and building community around shared interests  

These hobbies fuel my curiosity and creativity, helping me bring clarity, empathy, and perspective into everything I do—professionally and personally.
