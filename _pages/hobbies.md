When I’m not working with data or studying language, you’ll usually find me moving — physically or mentally.

## 🏋️‍♀️ Weightlifting  
I’m an avid weightlifter who thrives on discipline and growth. Strength training helps me focus, track progress, and stay grounded.

## 🥊 Boxing  
Boxing sharpens my mind and builds resilience. I love the mental clarity and focus it demands.

## ⛳ Golf  
I enjoy the strategy and patience golf requires — it's a quiet challenge that keeps me in tune with my surroundings.

## 📚 Reading  
Reading is a daily habit that fuels my curiosity and broadens my perspective. I especially love nonfiction, language theory, and sci-fi.

## 🧠 Lifelong Learning  
I’m constantly exploring new ideas — from linguistics and machine learning to entrepreneurship and motivation. I believe growth is a mindset.
