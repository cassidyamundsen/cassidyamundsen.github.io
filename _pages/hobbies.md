When I’m not working with data or studying language, I’m moving — physically and mentally.

## 🏋️‍♀️ Weightlifting  
I thrive on discipline, structure, and growth — in and out of the gym.

## 🥊 Boxing  
Boxing sharpens my focus, reflexes, and resilience.

## ⛳ Golf  
A balance of patience and precision — and a great excuse to unplug.

## 📚 Reading  
I devour books on linguistics, psychology, productivity, and sci-fi.

## 🧠 Lifelong Learning  
Whether it’s a new data tool or business idea, I’m always growing.
