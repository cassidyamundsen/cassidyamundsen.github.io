- Writing poetry and personal essays as a creative outlet  
- Professional content writing with a focus on voice, tone, and audience  
- Mixology and recipe development for social and sensory creativity  
- Attending live music and cultural events to stay inspired  

## Personal Growth & Creative Expression

- Hosting or contributing to writing and storytelling events  
- Exploring digital design and emerging technologies
