Outside of work, I invest in interests that support continuous learning, creativity, and resilienceâ€”traits that directly strengthen my professional skill set. These activities help me stay focused, adaptable, and engaged with the world around me.

## Relevant Interests

- Studying new languages to expand cross-cultural communication skills and linguistic insight  
- Practicing yoga and boxing to maintain focus, discipline, and mental resilience  
- Traveling to explore new perspectives and develop adaptability in unfamiliar environments  
- Writing poetry and essays to sharpen narrative voice, tone, and audience awareness  
- Reading nonfiction and contemporary literature to stay informed and intellectually curious  
- Developing cocktail recipes and content as a hands-on, creative outlet with an emphasis on detail and user experience  

Together, these pursuits enhance my ability to think critically, communicate clearly, and bring creative energy into collaborative projects.
